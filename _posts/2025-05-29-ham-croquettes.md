## Directions  

1. **Sauté Base**:  
   - In a pan, sauté the onion in butter and a little oil until soft.  

2. **Add Ham**:  
   - Stir in the minced ham.  

3. **Make the Roux**:  
   - Add flour and a pinch of nutmeg. Cook briefly.  

4. **Form Dough**:  
   - Stir in the milk first. When thickened, add the broth.  
   - Stir until smooth and uniform. Dough is ready when it pulls cleanly off a spoon or the pan.  

5. **Chill and Shape**:  
   - Cool the dough in the fridge overnight.  
   - Form into croquette shapes.  

6. **Fry**:  
   - Coat in egg and breadcrumbs, then deep-fry until golden.
