## Directions  

1. **Make the Green Sauce**:  
   - Blend garlic cloves, parsley, 100g of olive oil, and some salt into a thick green sauce.  

2. **Prepare the Squid**:  
   - Clean and cut squid into 1 cm squares.  
   - Heat the remaining oil in a pan and sauté the squid.  
   - Add the green sauce, then sweet paprika, and finally the grated tomatoes.  
   - Cook until the tomato water is reduced.  

3. **Build the Rice Base**:  
   - Add the squid ink and salt. Stir in the rice and cook for 1 minute to absorb flavors.  

4. **Cook the Rice**:  
   - Add hot fumet and boil for 8 minutes at medium-high heat without stirring.  
   - Shake the pan occasionally instead of stirring.  

5. **Bake**:  
   - Transfer the pan to a preheated oven at 250°C (480°F) for 8 more minutes.  

6. **Finish with Socarrat**:  
   - Place the pan back on the stovetop to form a light golden crust (socarrat).  

7. **Rest**:  
   - Let the rice rest for 10 minutes before serving.

## Tips  

- Use high-quality fumet made from sautéed vegetables and rockfish, simmered and reduced to a third.  
- Short and round rice varieties like Bomba, Bahía, or Siena are ideal. Avoid long-grain rice like Basmati or Jasmine.  
- Always use the same rice variety to maintain water ratios.  
- Use a large, flat pan to ensure rice is no thicker than 1.5 cm.
