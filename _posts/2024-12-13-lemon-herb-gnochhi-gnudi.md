## Directions  

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and flour a parchment-lined sheet pan  

2. **Prep Ricotta**:  
   - If using store-bought ricotta, line a strainer with cheesecloth or three layers of paper towels  
   - Spoon ricotta onto the cheesecloth/paper towels and let excess liquid drain for 4 hours  
   - If ricotta is too wet, the dough won't hold together  

3. **Make the Dough**:  
   - In a large bowl, combine ricotta, egg, Parmesan, herbs, lemon zest, cayenne, salt, and pepper Mix well  
   - Sift the flour over the wet ingredients and gently mix until incorporated  

4. **Test Dough**:  
   - Roll a tablespoon-sized portion of dough into a log and place it into the boiling water  
   - Once it floats, let it cook for at least 3 minutes Remove and cool  
   - Taste and adjust seasoning or add 1–2 tablespoons of flour if necessary Repeat the test if the dough falls apart  

5. **Shape the Gnocchi**:  
   - **Piping Method**: Fit a pastry bag with an XL star or round tip Pipe the dough onto the sheet pan in 1" lengths  
   - **Roll and Cut Method**: Roll the dough into logs and cut into 1" lengths Gently roll with a fork to create slight indentations  

6. **Cook the Gnocchi**:  
   - Place gnocchi into boiling water and cook until they float, the water returns to a boil, and the gnocchi begin to swell (5–7 minutes depending on size)  

7. **Prepare the Brown Butter Sauce**:  
   - Add butter to a stainless steel saucepan Melt over medium heat and allow it to foam and recede  
   - After a few minutes, milk solids will sink and turn caramel-brown, creating a nutty aroma  
   - Turn off the heat and add fresh herbs and capers (optional) Pour the mixture into a bowl and set aside  

8. **Deglaze and Assemble**:  
   - Return the pan to the heat and deglaze with white wine, reducing to about 2 tablespoons  
   - Add the brown butter mixture back to the pan, stir, then add gnocchi and toss gently
