## Directions  

1. **Prep the Components**:  
   - Separate egg whites and yolks into different bowls.  
   - Whip egg whites with a few drops of lemon juice until stiff peaks form. Set aside.  
   - Whip the heavy cream in another bowl until soft peaks form. Set aside.

2. **Make the Mascarpone Cream**:  
   - Whisk the yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy.  
   - Add mascarpone and whisk until smooth.  
   - Fold in the whipped cream using a spatula.  
   - Gently fold in the whipped egg whites last, mixing carefully to preserve the volume.

3. **Assemble the Tiramisù**:  
   - Dip each ladyfinger briefly into coffee (turning 180° once) and place in a pan to cover the bottom.  
   - Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the soaked ladyfingers.  
   - Repeat with a second layer of dipped ladyfingers and remaining cream.

4. **Finish and Chill**:  
   - Top with chocolate shavings.  
   - Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (12 hours is best for flavor and texture).

## Note  

The origins of tiramisù are disputed, with Tuscany, Piedmont, and Veneto all laying claim. One story credits 17th-century Siena with inventing the dessert for Cosimo de Medici, originally calling it *zuppa del duca* ("the Duke’s soup").
